        "4 years programming experience with the computational algebra package Magma, ran on Linux machines, including (but not limited to) working with large matrix representations of groups and subsequent subgroups, group modules of high dimension, maximal tori, root systems and subsystems, groups of Lie type and parabolic subgroups, irreducible modules over finite fields and their projective covers.",
        "Designing and modifying mathematical algorithms in algebra, group theory, representation theory and Lie group theory and then implementing them to run efficiently in Magma. This includes writing, modifying and testing code for constructing centralisers, normalisers, parabolic subgroups and their subsequent Levi-complements, maximal tori, maximal and non-maximal proper subgroups and group modules.",
        "Experienced at handling vast amounts of data produced from code output whilst working with a limited storage capacity. This includes how to store data efficiently and organise it to ensure easy use and access in the future.",
