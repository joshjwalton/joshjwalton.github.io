Hello! I am a final year PhD student, researching maximal subgroups and representation theory of finite groups of Lie type through the means of the computational algebra at the University of Manchester, U.K. My thesis title is: ?.

My research interests include, but are not limited to, matrix representations of finite simple groups, Lie algebras and their associated root systems and maximal subgroups of finite exceptional groups of Lie type. More generally, I am interested in the development and implementation of mathematical algprithms to solve open problems in finite group theory and representation theory. I conduct most of my current research using <a href='https://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/magma/'>Magma</a>.

Compatible files associated to my research can be found <a href='https://joshjwalton.github.io/projects/'>here</a>.

When I'm not researching I'm probably either tearing my hair out trying to solve an impossibly hard sudoku or riding my bike.

If you have any questions regarding my work or anything else, please do not hesitate to contact me.
