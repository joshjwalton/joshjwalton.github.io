A final year PhD student, with 4 years of programming experience using Magma, researching maximal subgroups and representation theory of finite groups of Lie type through the means of the computational algebra. I aspire to further my career with a post-doctoral research role involving the development and implementation of computational algebra to solve open problems in algebra, group theory and representation theory. I am an articulate and clear communicator of mathematics with a strong university level teaching portfolio.
